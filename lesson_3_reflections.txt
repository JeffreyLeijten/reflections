When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When working with other people or if you would want feedback on your project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Sometimes you don't want to directly publish a branch because it's still a work in progress
