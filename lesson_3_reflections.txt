When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When working with other people or if you would want feedback on your project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Sometimes you don't want to directly publish a branch because it's still a work in progress

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A clone is a local copy of a repository, a fork is a github repository cloned from another github repository
a branch is a series of commits in a repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
So you can reference where possible changes could have occurred 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Only having one person working at a time or having people working on different pieces of code.
